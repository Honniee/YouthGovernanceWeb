# SK Terms Data Integrity Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive data integrity validation system implemented for SK Terms management. The system ensures data consistency, prevents conflicts, and maintains referential integrity across the database.

## Key Features

### 1. Term Overlap Validation
**Critical for data integrity** - Prevents conflicting term date ranges that could cause data inconsistencies.

#### Types of Overlaps Detected:
- **Start Overlap**: New term starts during an existing term
- **End Overlap**: New term ends during an existing term  
- **Complete Containment**: New term completely contains an existing term
- **Complete Within**: New term is completely within an existing term

#### Implementation:
```sql
SELECT term_id, term_name, start_date, end_date, status 
FROM "SK_Terms" 
WHERE (
  (start_date <= $1 AND end_date >= $1) OR    -- New term starts during existing term
  (start_date <= $2 AND end_date >= $2) OR    -- New term ends during existing term
  (start_date >= $1 AND end_date <= $2) OR    -- New term completely contains existing term
  (start_date <= $1 AND end_date >= $2)       -- New term completely within existing term
)
AND status != 'completed'
```

#### Real-World Impact:
- **Prevents**: Multiple active terms running simultaneously
- **Ensures**: Clear term boundaries for official assignments
- **Maintains**: Accurate historical records and reporting

### 2. Active Term Uniqueness
**Ensures only one active term at a time** - Critical business rule for SK governance.

#### Validation Logic:
- Checks for existing active terms before activation
- Prevents auto-activation conflicts during term creation
- Ensures clean term transitions

#### Implementation:
```sql
SELECT term_id, term_name, start_date, end_date 
FROM "SK_Terms" 
WHERE status = 'active'
```

#### Business Impact:
- **Prevents**: Confusion about which term is currently active
- **Ensures**: Officials are assigned to the correct term
- **Maintains**: Clear governance structure

### 3. Term Name Uniqueness
**Prevents duplicate term names** - Ensures clear identification and prevents confusion.

#### Implementation:
```sql
SELECT term_id, term_name 
FROM "SK_Terms" 
WHERE LOWER(term_name) = LOWER($1)
```

#### Benefits:
- **Prevents**: Confusion between similar term names
- **Ensures**: Clear audit trails and reporting
- **Maintains**: Data quality and user experience

### 4. Enhanced Date Validation
**Prevents invalid date ranges** - Comprehensive date boundary checking.

#### Validation Rules:
- **Start Date**: Cannot be more than 30 days in the past (for new terms)
- **End Date**: Cannot be more than 10 years in the future
- **Duration**: Must be between 1-5 years (365-1825 days)
- **Business Logic**: Start date must be before end date

#### Implementation:
```javascript
// Check if start date is in the past (for new terms)
if (!isUpdate && startDate < currentDate) {
  const daysDiff = Math.ceil((currentDate - startDate) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
  if (daysDiff > 30) {
    errors.push(`Start date cannot be more than 30 days in the past (${daysDiff} days ago)`);
  }
}

// Check if end date is too far in the future
const maxFutureYears = 10;
const maxEndDate = new Date();
maxEndDate.setFullYear(maxEndDate.getFullYear() + maxFutureYears);

if (endDate > maxEndDate) {
  errors.push(`End date cannot be more than ${maxFutureYears} years in the future`);
}
```

#### Real-World Impact:
- **Prevents**: Unrealistic term durations
- **Ensures**: Reasonable planning horizons
- **Maintains**: Data credibility and user trust

### 5. Referential Integrity Checks
**Ensures database consistency** - Monitors relationships between tables.

#### Checks Performed:
- **Orphaned Officials**: Officials without valid terms
- **Empty Completed Terms**: Completed terms without officials
- **Foreign Key Consistency**: Ensures all references are valid

#### Implementation:
```sql
-- Check for orphaned officials
SELECT COUNT(*) as count 
FROM "SK_Officials" so
LEFT JOIN "SK_Terms" st ON so.term_id = st.term_id
WHERE st.term_id IS NULL

-- Check for empty completed terms
SELECT COUNT(*) as count 
FROM "SK_Terms" st
LEFT JOIN "SK_Officials" so ON st.term_id = so.term_id
WHERE st.status = 'completed' AND so.term_id IS NULL
```

#### Benefits:
- **Detects**: Data inconsistencies early
- **Prevents**: Reporting errors and system failures
- **Maintains**: Data quality and system reliability

### 6. Business Rule Validations
**Enforces organizational policies** - Ensures compliance with governance rules.

#### Rules Implemented:
- **Term Span Limits**: Terms cannot span unreasonable time periods
- **Naming Conventions**: Suggested pattern validation (SK Term YYYY-YYYY)
- **Status Transitions**: Proper term lifecycle management

#### Implementation:
```javascript
// Ensure terms don't span across unreasonable time periods
const currentYear = currentDate.getFullYear();
const startYear = startDate.getFullYear();
const endYear = endDate.getFullYear();

if (startYear < currentYear - 5) {
  errors.push('Start date cannot be more than 5 years in the past');
}

if (endYear > currentYear + 10) {
  errors.push('End date cannot be more than 10 years in the future');
}

// Validate term naming convention (optional business rule)
const termNamePattern = /^SK Term \d{4}-\d{4}$/;
if (!termNamePattern.test(data.termName.trim())) {
  console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è Term name does not follow suggested pattern (SK Term YYYY-YYYY)');
}
```

## Validation Functions

### 1. `validateTermCreation(data, isUpdate, client)`
Comprehensive validation for term creation and updates.

**Parameters:**
- `data`: Term data object
- `isUpdate`: Boolean indicating if this is an update operation
- `client`: Database client for integrity checks

**Returns:**
```javascript
{
  isValid: boolean,
  errors: string[],
  sanitizedData: object
}
```

### 2. `validateTermActivation(termId, client)`
Validates term activation to prevent conflicts.

**Parameters:**
- `termId`: ID of term to activate
- `client`: Database client

**Returns:**
```javascript
string[] // Array of error messages
```

### 3. `validateTermCompletion(termId, client)`
Validates term completion and warns about active officials.

**Parameters:**
- `termId`: ID of term to complete
- `client`: Database client

**Returns:**
```javascript
string[] // Array of error messages
```

## Integration Points

### Controller Integration
All validation functions are integrated into the SK Terms controller:

```javascript
// In createTerm function
const validation = await validateTermCreation(data, false, client);
if (!validation.isValid) {
  return res.status(400).json({
    success: false,
    message: 'Validation failed',
    errors: validation.errors
  });
}

// In activateTerm function
const validationErrors = await validateTermActivation(id, client);
if (validationErrors.length > 0) {
  return res.status(400).json({
    success: false,
    message: 'Term activation validation failed',
    errors: validationErrors
  });
}

// In completeTerm function
const validationErrors = await validateTermCompletion(id, client);
if (validationErrors.length > 0) {
  return res.status(400).json({
    success: false,
    message: 'Term completion validation failed',
    errors: validationErrors
  });
}
```

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling with specific error messages:

```javascript
// Database errors
if (txErr.code === '23505') { // unique_violation
  return res.status(409).json({
    success: false,
    message: 'Term with this name already exists'
  });
}

// Validation errors
return res.status(400).json({
  success: false,
  message: 'Validation failed',
  errors: validation.errors
});
```

## Testing

### Test Coverage
Comprehensive test suite covering all validation scenarios:

- **Basic Validation**: Required fields, length limits, date ranges
- **Overlap Detection**: Various overlap scenarios
- **Uniqueness Checks**: Term names, active terms
- **Date Validation**: Past/future limits, duration rules
- **Referential Integrity**: Orphaned records, empty terms
- **Business Rules**: Naming conventions, status transitions

### Test Structure
```javascript
describe('SK Terms Data Integrity Validation', () => {
  describe('Term Creation Validation', () => {
    test('should validate basic required fields', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
    
    test('should validate term name length', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
  
  describe('Term Overlap Validation', () => {
    test('should detect overlapping terms', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

## Performance Considerations

### Database Queries
- **Optimized Queries**: All validation queries are optimized for performance
- **Index Usage**: Leverages existing database indexes
- **Minimal Impact**: Validation adds minimal overhead to operations

### Caching Strategy
- **No Caching**: Validation results are not cached to ensure real-time accuracy
- **Fresh Data**: Always validates against current database state
- **Consistency**: Ensures data integrity at all times

## Monitoring and Logging

### Debug Logging
Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting:

```javascript
console.log('üîç Validating term overlap...');
console.log('‚úÖ No term overlap detected');
console.log('‚ùå Term overlap detected:', overlappingTerms);
console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è Found orphaned SK officials without valid terms:', orphanedCount);
```

### Audit Trail
All validation failures are logged for audit purposes:

```javascript
// Create audit log for validation failures
universalAuditService.logValidationFailure('sk-terms', {
  operation: 'creation',
  data: data,
  errors: validation.errors
}, universalAuditService.createUserContext(req));
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Advanced Overlap Detection**: More sophisticated overlap algorithms
2. **Predictive Validation**: AI-powered validation suggestions
3. **Custom Business Rules**: Configurable validation rules per organization
4. **Performance Optimization**: Query optimization and caching strategies

### Scalability Considerations
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Validation functions are stateless
- **Database Sharding**: Validation supports distributed databases
- **Microservices**: Can be extracted into separate validation service
